I was one of the two engineers, with three students in other disciplines occasionally touching the codebase. The Theatre of Evolution is a local multiplayer 4X strategy with three kinds of civilizations that the player can control and a unique system of resource management. I implemented pathfinding, the core population/production/resource mechanics, parts of the UI, a configuration system for defining units, civilizations, and attacks, an object tracking system to track the sources of memory leaks, as well as doing most of the debugging.</p><p>Installation Notes</p>The game was primarily tested on Windows 8/10 on screen resolutions of 1920x1080 or higher. While it may be compatible with other Windows versions and screen resolutions, it has not been tested in those contexts.
