Drop Serene is a first person puzzle/horror game that tries to subvert horror genre conventions by making the player afraid of the light. As a "strike team" project, it has only placeholder art assets. In my dual roles as game designer and engineer, I balanced the game's parameters (monster speed, player stamina, sound effect volumes, etc.), helped design the core mechanics, and consulted with the level designers on improving the difficulty curve and game feel. I prototyped many of the mechanics that made it into the game (as well as some that didn't), and collaborated with the two engineers on the game's AI.
