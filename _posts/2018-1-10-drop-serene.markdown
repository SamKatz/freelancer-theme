Drop Serene is a first person puzzle/horror game that tries to subvert player expectations by making the player afraid of the light. As a strike team project, it has only placeholder art assets. I was the game designer, so I balanced the game's parameters (monster speed, player stamina, sound effect volumes, etc.), helped design the core mechanics, and consulted with the level designers on improving the difficulty curve and game feel. Additionally my actual responsibilities also included a fair amount of programming. I prototyped many of the mechanics that made it into this version of the game in a separate Unity project, collaborated with the two engineers on the vector math an AI required to make the game work, and took over hard to identify but non-critical bugs in order to free the engineers to pursue critical features.
