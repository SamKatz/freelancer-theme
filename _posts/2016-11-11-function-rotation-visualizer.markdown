description: <p><a href=https://github.com/SamKatz/FunctionRotationGrapher>Source Code</a></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0SYXy6axNB7Vng5dVk5RTRlclE">Download</a></p>This function graphing utility was created by a high school classmate named Joshua Ferrell and I during the August of 2014. This version of the application with the natives bundled in will only work on Windows. It's capable of graphing functions through a GUI and supports navigating the rotation of a 2D equation about an axis in three dimensions. The escape key will close opened graphs - 3D graphs can be navigated using WASD for horizontal movement, and the Q and E keys to ascend and descend. I personally created almost all of the program with the exception of the 3D camera navigation system (my contributions there were limited to debugging and tuning). The program is written in Java and uses the Lightweight Java Graphics Library (LWJGL) and an equation parsing library called exp4j.
