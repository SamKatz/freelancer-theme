description: This function graphing utility was created by me and a high school classmate named Joshua Ferrell during the August of 2014. This version of the application will only work on Windows. It's capable of graphing functions through a GUI and supports navigating the rotation of a 2D equation about an axis in three dimensions. The escape key will close opened graphs - 3D graphs can be navigated using WASD for horizontal movement, and the Q and E keys to ascend and descend. I personally created almost all of the program with the exception of the 3D camera navigation system (my contributions there were limited to debugging and tuning). The program was in Java - and uses the Lightweight Java Graphics Library (LWJGL) and an equation parsing library called exp4j.
