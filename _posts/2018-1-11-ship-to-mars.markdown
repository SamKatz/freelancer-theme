As the sole programmer on the team, I was responsible for implementing other team members art assets, implementing gameplay, designing and implementing the user interface, assessing feature feasibility, and evaluating hardware specifications. The project in its current state was put through a successful live test in the museum in Fall 2017 semester and Spring 2018.</p><p>Installation Notes</p>Ship To Mars is intended as a static museum installation - to be run on a very specific touchscreen computer and exiting the game to the desktop shouldn't be possible from the main menu. As such, the only supported resolution is 1920 x 1080, and the game can only be exited using ALT-F4 or an equivalent shortcut. Visual aberrations and UI scaling issues may appear in different screen configurations.
