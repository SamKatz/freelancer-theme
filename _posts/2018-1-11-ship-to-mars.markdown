As the sole programmer on the team, I was responsible for implementing other team members art assets, implementing gameplay, designing and implementing the user interface, assessing feature feasibility, and evaluating hardware specifications. The project in its current state was put through a successful live test in the museum at the end of the Fall 2017 semester and will continue to be developed in Spring 2018. Planned additions include a complete UI overhaul, a tutorial system, along with assorted bugfixes.</p><p>Installation Notes</p>Ship To Mars is intended as a static museum installation - to be run on a very specific touchscreen computer and exiting the game to the desktop shouldn't be possible from the main menu. As such, the only supported resolution until closer to version 1.0 is 1920 x 1080, and the game can only be exited using ALT-F4 or an equivalent shortcut. Visual aberrations and UI scaling issues may appear in different screen configurations.
