description: This academic project was created with Christopher Knoll between the summer and fall of 2016 - with most of the work ocurring in the last week of that period. The project was created in Unity, and large parts of it were coded in a somewhat haphazard manner in order to meet a deadline - and are not sterling examples of software engineering. It incorporates two third party libraries - SpriteTile (which renders the level geometry) and Aron Granberg's A* Pathfinding Project (which is used in the AI programming) - some of the game's AI was adapted from example code from this last library. All art assets used in the project are either basic geometric shapes, under an open license, or used under fair use. I implemented most of the mechanics - the AI, player abilities, condition manager, projectiles, user interface, entity framework, and a number of miscellaneous items present in the project. Grognak.exe is an earlier build of the game with a single player, and contains a brief tutorial. Grognakcoop.exe expects the presence of a PS4 controller connected via USB to control the second player.
