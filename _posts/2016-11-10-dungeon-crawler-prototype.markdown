The project was created in Unity and the internal structure of some sections should make it obvious is was a prototype. It incorporates two third party libraries - SpriteTile (which renders the level geometry) and Aron Granberg's A* Pathfinding Project (which is used in the AI programming) - some of the game's AI was adapted from example code from this last library. All art assets used in the project are either basic geometric shapes or under an open license. I implemented most of the mechanics - the AI, player abilities, condition manager, projectiles, user interface, entity framework, and a number of miscellaneous items present in the project. Grognak.exe is a build of the game with a single player, and contains a brief tutorial. Grognakcoop.exe expects the presence of a PS4 controller connected via USB to control the second player.
