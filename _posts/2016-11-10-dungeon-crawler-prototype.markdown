It incorporates two third party libraries - SpriteTile (which renders the level geometry) and Aron Granberg's A* Pathfinding Project (which is used in the AI). All art assets are placeholders under an open license. I implemented most of the mechanics - the AI, player abilities, condition manager, projectiles, user interface, and entity framework. Grognak.exe is a build of the game with a single player, and contains a brief tutorial. Grognakcoop.exe expects the presence of a PS4 controller connected via USB to control the second player.
