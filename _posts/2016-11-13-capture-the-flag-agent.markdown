description: Firstly, a disclaimer. Exactly one source file in this folder is written by me - sak140130agent.java. Everything else was written by either UTD's Professor Vincent Ng, and is hosted here with his permission. To clarify, non of the UI or framework for this project was created by me - one AI agent contained therein is my creation. Our final project in my Artificial Intelligence class (shown here) was to write a pathfinding agent that would coordinate the movements of two triangles playing capture the flag with another two triangles. This project is more complicated than it appears - since each agent can only observe adjacent spaces, does not know its exact location, does not know the exact location of any enemies, it's partner, it's own flag, the enemies flag, or the map layout. Our final grade was based on our performance in a competition against the AI agents of our classmates. My agent came in first, beating 34 other students organized into 25 teams. My agent utilizes a modified version of A* pathfinding that attempts to deal with the problems of pathfinding through unknown terrain, uses the agent's compass to coordinate with its partner, and has a bit of higher level strategy in deciding whether to return to base to guard its own flag. In order to run the project, make sure you have a somewhat recent version of a Java Runtime Environment and a Java Development Kit. Then launch the project with "start.bat". Once the project starts, change the option under "Team 1" to ctf.agent.Sak140130agent. Feel free to change the board set (although my agent performs best on more complicated maps), delay (this controls how long it waits between each turn), and color map as you see fit. Then click "Un-pause" and watch the agents play out a game of capture the flag - my agents will be those on the left. You'll have to un-pause again after each capture of the flag.
