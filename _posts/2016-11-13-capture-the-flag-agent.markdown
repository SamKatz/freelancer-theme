Each students program was pitted against the others in a tournament in which my program placed first. Two teams of two agents each observe the spaces adjacent to them in a grid, and take turns moving around in an unknown area to try and locate an enemy flag and return it to their base. Agents do not know their own location, but do know the direction (not location) of the enemy flag and their own flag. My agent uses a modified version of A* pathfinding to navigate through areas whose passability is unknown. The two agents update a single shared knowledge of the area's layout at soon as they have found a landmark that lets them reconcile their maps with each other. </p><p>Instuctions</p><p>In order to run the project, make sure you have a somewhat recent version of a Java Runtime Environment and a Java Development Kit. Then launch the project with "start.bat". Once the project starts, change the option under "Team 1" to ctf.agent.Sak140130agent. Feel free to change the board set (although my agent performs best on more complicated maps), delay (this controls how long it waits between each turn), and color map as you see fit. Then click "Un-pause" and watch the agents play out a game of capture the flag - my agents will be those on the left. You'll have to un-pause again after each capture of the flag. Please note that the UI and the dummy agents (those are than sak140130agent) are the property of UTD's Professor Vincent Ng.</p>
